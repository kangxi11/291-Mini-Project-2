los angeles, dec. 13 (bloomberg energy) -- u.s. western spot&#10;power prices declined today from a combination of warmer weather&#10;across the region and declining natural gas prices.&#10; according to belton, missouri-based weather derivatives inc.,&#10;temperatures in the pacific northwest will average about 2 degrees&#10;fahrenheit above normal for the next seven days. in the southwest&#10;temperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal.&#10; at the california-oregon border, heavy load power fell&#10;$172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00.&#10; &quot;what happened to all of this bitter cold weather we were&#10;supposed to have,&apos;&apos; said one northwest power marketer. since the&#10;weather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower.&quot;&#10; temperatures in los angeles today will peak at 66 degrees,&#10;and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend.&#10; natural gas to be delivered to the california oregon from the&#10;el paso pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday.&#10; &quot;gas prices are declining causing western daily power prices&#10;to fall,&apos;&apos; said one northwest power trader.&#10; at the np-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased&#10;$206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00. light load energy fell&#10;to $200.00-$350.00, falling $175.00 from yesterday.&#10; psc of new mexico&apos;s 498-megawatt san juan unit 4 coal plant&#10;was shut down this morning for a tube leak. the unit is scheduled&#10;to restart this weekend.&#10; at the four corners located in new mexico, power traded at&#10;$325.00-$335.00 plunging $182.50 from yesterday.&#10;&#10;-robert scalabrino&#10;&#10;&#10;pjm spot power prices dip with weather, falling natural gas&#10;&#10; philadelphia, dec. 13 (bloomberg energy) -- peak next-day&#10;power prices declined at the western hub of the pennsylvania-new&#10;jersey-maryland interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts and&#10;falling natural gas prices, traders said.&#10; the bloomberg index price for peak thursday power at western&#10;pjm declined an average of $12.75 a megawatt-hour, with trades&#10;ranging from $62.00-$76.00.&#10; lexington, massachusetts-based weather services corp.&#10;forecast tomorrow&apos;s high temperature in philadelphia at 40 degrees&#10;fahrenheit, up 7 degrees from today&apos;s expected high. temperatures&#10;could climb as high as 42 degrees by friday.&#10; &quot;most of the day&apos;s activity took place in the early part of&#10;the morning,&quot; said one pjm-based trader. &quot;by options expiration&#10;the market had pretty much dried up.&quot;&#10; traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main&#10;reason for the decline in spot market prices.&#10; bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the&#10;new york city gate declined an average of $1.25 per million&#10;british thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million btu. since&#10;monday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of&#10;$2.44 per million btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecasts&#10;indicated reduced utility load requirements.&#10; in new york, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they&#10;normally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather&#10;forecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets.&#10; peak next-day power at the zone a delivery point sold $6.13&#10;higher at a bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the&#10;$67.00-$75.00 range. power at zone j sold $7.50 higher at $90.00-&#10;$92.00.&#10; ~&#10;-karyn rispoli&#10;&#10;&#10;mid-continent power prices drop on revised forecast, gas prices&#10;&#10; cincinnati, dec. 13 (bloomberg energy) -- u.s. mid-continent&#10;next-day peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revised&#10;warmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said.&#10; the bloomberg index price for peak thursday power on the&#10;cincinnati-based cinergy corp. transmission system dropped $23.19&#10;to $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as the&#10;market opened down to $59.00 after options expired.&#10; in mid-america interconnected network trading, peak power on&#10;the chicago-based commonwealth edison co. grid sold $21.37 lower&#10;on average at $60.00-$75.00, while power in lower main sold $18.17&#10;lower at $65.00-$100.00.&#10; belton, missouri-based weather derivatives inc. predicted&#10;high temperatures would average 2 degrees fahrenheit above normal&#10;in chicago and at normal levels in cincinnati over the next seven&#10;days, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal monday, respectively.&#10; traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled&#10;prices down. natural gas prices were a large factor in recent&#10;electricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-fired&#10;generation to meet increased weather-related demand.&#10; spot natural gas at the cincinnati city gate sold an average&#10;of 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million british&#10;thermal units. spot gas at the chicago city gate sold an average&#10;of 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million btu.&#10; &quot;the weather&apos;s moderating and gas is down, so you&apos;ve got&#10;people coming to their senses,&quot; one trader said. &quot;these are much&#10;more realistic prices.&quot;&#10; traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the&#10;outlook for weather continues to be mild. peak cinergy power for&#10;delivery from dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00&#10;yesterday.&#10; mid-continent area power pool peak spot power prices plunged&#10;with warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission&#10;capacity, selling $37.67 less in northern mapp and $44.17 less in&#10;southern mapp at $75.00-$125.00.&#10; &quot;what&apos;s happening is the people who don&apos;t have firm&#10;transmission are getting into the market early and buying at those&#10;high prices since they have no choice,&quot; one mapp trader said.&#10; &quot;then you&apos;ve got some people who were lucky enough to get a&#10;firm path who waited until later in the morning when comed prices&#10;fell off,&quot; he said, &quot;and bought from them at those lower prices,&#10;causing the huge gap between the day&apos;s high and low trade.&quot;&#10;&#10;-ken fahnestock&#10;&#10;&#10;southeast u.s. electricity prices slump after mild forecast&#10;&#10; atlanta, georgia, dec. 13 (bloomberg energy) -- southeast&#10;u.s. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was&#10;forecast for the region this week, traders said.&#10; traders said southeast utility demand has been reduced since&#10;many large population centers like atlanta will see temperatures&#10;climb into the mid-50s fahrenheit later this week.&#10; &quot;there was nothing going on in florida today,&quot; said one&#10;southern energy trader. &quot;everything was going to markets in the&#10;north.&quot;&#10; traders said supply was being routed from florida into&#10;markets on the entergy corp. and the tennessee valley authority&#10;grid in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour.&#10; &quot;prices into tva started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled as&#10;forecasts came out,&quot; said on entergy power trader. &quot;prices,&#10;declined to $60 and less.&quot;&#10; the bloomberg into tva index price fell an average of $23.95&#10;to $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00 range. off-peak trades&#10;were noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recent&#10;estimates.&#10; southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weather&#10;forecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week&#10;caused prices to decline in the region.&#10; in the southwest power pool, traders said warmer weather was&#10;the main culprit behind lower prices.&#10; &quot;the cold weather&apos;s backing off,&quot; said one spp utility&#10;trader. &quot;it was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and&#10;today it&apos;s about 9 degrees with the wind chill. yesterday, it was&#10;bitter cold and today it was just plain cold.&quot;&#10; power sold in northern sections of spp at $78-$100, though&#10;the bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to $88.00. southern&#10;spp traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday.&#10;&#10;-brian whary&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;u.k. day-ahead electricity prices rise amid increased demand&#10;&#10; london, dec. 13 (bloomberg energy) -- electricity prices in&#10;the u.k. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to&#10;increase household consumption for space heating, traders said.&#10; the day-ahead baseload pool purchase price, calculated by the&#10;electricity pool of england and wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01&#10;pounds a megawatt-hour.&#10; temperatures across the u.k. were forecast to fall 6 degrees&#10;to 4 degrees celsius by the weekend, according to weather services&#10;corp. in the u.s.&#10; day-ahead electricity forward agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15&#10;pounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday.&#10; december continued to fall amid a combination of position&#10;closing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will&#10;not rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said.&#10; december 2000 baseload efas traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds a&#10;megawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday&apos;s last trade.&#10; first quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with&#10;expectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue&#10;to stifle demand, traders said.&#10; january 2001 baseload efas dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds a&#10;megawatt-hour, falling 17 pence.&#10; first quarter 2001 baseload efas traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds a&#10;megawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close.&#10; season structures traded on the u.k. power exchange, summer&#10;2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour.&#10;winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a&#10;megawatt-hour.&#10; open positions on many short-term structures will likely&#10;force many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run-&#10;up to christmas, traders said. adding that other structures will&#10;probably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more&#10;easily be assessed.&#10;&#10;-nick livingstone&#10;&#10;&#10;nordic electricity prices climb following cold weather forecast&#10;&#10; lysaker, norway, dec. 13 (bloomberg energy) -- power prices&#10;on the nord pool exchange in lysaker, norway, closed higher today&#10;as colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said.&#10; week 51 dealt between 145-152 norwegian kroner a megawatt-&#10;hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday&apos;s closing trade on 1,076&#10;megawatts of traded volume. week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446&#10;megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.&#10; supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede after&#10;forecasts indicated reduced precipitation over scandinavia for&#10;next week. these producers typically generate power to prevent&#10;reservoirs from overflowing.&#10; consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise&#10;with falling temperatures because of increased requirements for&#10;space heating.&#10; traded volume on the power exchange increased in active&#10;trading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders&#10;said.&#10; &quot;the market&apos;s been waiting for this day for a long time,&quot; a&#10;stockholm-based trader said. &quot;for too long, people have been&#10;selling because winter hasn&apos;t lived up to expectations. we should&#10;now see a noticeable increase in the spot price.&quot;&#10; temperatures in parts of scandinavia were forecast to fall&#10;below freezing to minus 5 degrees celsius, with only limited&#10;chances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to weather&#10;services corp. in the u.s.&#10; the day-ahead system average area price fell after demand was&#10;expected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict&#10;temperatures to begin falling.&#10; thursday&apos;s system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22&#10;percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. traded volume fell&#10;4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.&#10; many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise&#10;by 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.&#10; winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter-&#10;term contracts.&#10; winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour,&#10;1.9 kroner below yesterday&apos;s last trade at 135.25 kroner a&#10;megawatt-hour.&#10; also, the delayed restart at a swedish nuclear unit, although&#10;expected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producers&#10;to meet the increased demand, other traders said.&#10; vattenfall&apos;s ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor,&#10;will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.&#10; today&apos;s rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used&#10;today&apos;s news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said.&#10;&#10;-nick livingstone&#10;-0- (bes) dec/13/2000 21:04 gmt&#10;=0f$&#10;&#10;&#10;

at&#10;$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000&#10;which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. the investment prior to&#10;obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement&#10;provided it was for direct costs. thus, the additional equity for the&#10;improvement loan would be $0-$184,000. even if the maximum loan would&#10;cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds&#10;spent. the higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the&#10;preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. the engineer is preparing a&#10;tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can&#10;significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.&#10;&#10;phasing works as follows. if the first phase was say 40 units, the total&#10;lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot. of this, probably&#10;$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost. the&#10;improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design&#10;costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and&#10;landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land. the land loan for&#10;undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which i would&#10;estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot. then the&#10;loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot. this would give&#10;you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required&#10;of $241,000. this was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing&#10;is depended on a more careful assessment by the civil engineer as the&#10;separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility&#10;standpoint.&#10;&#10;construction loans&#10;there are three types of construction loans. first, is a speculative&#10;(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. second, is&#10;a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the&#10;builder/developers name. third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction&#10;loan in the name of the buyer. we expect to have up to 8 spec loans to&#10;start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans&#10;in the name of the builder/developer. we do not expect to have any&#10;construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too&#10;difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.&#10;&#10;spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for&#10;pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will&#10;be from 80% to 95% of value.&#10;&#10;disbursements&#10;disbursements will be handled by the general partner to cover current and&#10;near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority&#10;payments and then to the partners per the agreement. the general partner&#10;will contract with creekside builders, llc to construct the units and the&#10;fee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to&#10;15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.&#10;these fees are the only monies to creekside, larry lewter or myself prior to&#10;calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership&#10;expenses and b) direct payment to cb for any subcontractor costs that it has&#10;to perform. for example, if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or&#10;cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this&#10;function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain&#10;from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.&#10;finally, cb will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is&#10;used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. at present cb does not own&#10;any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track&#10;to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.&#10;&#10;reporting&#10;we are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.&#10;what did you have in mind? i would like to use some form of internet based&#10;reporting.&#10;&#10;bookkeeping&#10;i am not sure what you are referring to by the question, &quot;bookkeeping&#10;procedures to record actual expenses?&quot;

&#10;subject: westgate proforma-phillip allen.xls&#10;&#10;&#10;enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the westgate property is austin&#10;that we told you about. as you can tell from the proforma this project&#10;should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.&#10;this is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as&#10;austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for&#10;this market. this is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we&#10;have uncovered to date in the austin market.&#10;the project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. as&#10;it is in the &quot;smart growth corridor&quot; area designated by the city of austin&#10;for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete&#10;in less than 6 months. additionally, many of the current and more severe&#10;water treatment ordinances have been waived. i have estimated the lot&#10;improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in north&#10;austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street&#10;widening. even though this property is not likely to require street&#10;widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond&#10;requirement, i used this data to be cautious.&#10; the lone star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not&#10;expected to impact sales significantly. other projects have been quite&#10;successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the&#10;adjoining single family residential and a project at st. edwards university.&#10;as with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods&#10;is uneven. we have included a fence around the entire property, but may&#10;only put it on westgate and cameron loop. gated communities are far&#10;preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer&#10;preferences.&#10;the seller accepted our offer thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and&#10;an extended escrow. this will enable us to probably obtain an approved site&#10;plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into&#10;an a&amp;d loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.&#10;this analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the&#10;profits of the project. as we discussed in san marcos, we can also discuss&#10;having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity&#10;with your profit in the lot. i believe this would facilitate the use of a&#10;1031 exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a&#10;rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then&#10;be the equity for that project. you would need to discuss this with an&#10;exchange expert first. larry lewter knows an expert in the field in san&#10;antonio if you do not know anyone.&#10;i will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,&#10;by airborne express today for saturday delivery.&#10;once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to&#10;schedule a tour of the site and the area. please get back to me as soon as&#10;your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any&#10;time. you can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either&#10;512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110. my cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is&#10;512-338-1103. i look forward to hearing from you and to working with you&#10;on this project that is sure to be a major winner.&#10;i regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual&#10;events these past few weeks. a small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg&#10;downdrafts hit the south part of austin where we are building 10 town homes.&#10;one of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to&#10;start the next day. the severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough&#10;to knock it down. the city shut down the project for a week and it took&#10;another week to get every thing back on tract. then last week i had to take&#10;my wife to emergency. she has a bulge in the material between the vertebra&#10;in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this&#10;past week.. there is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize&#10;the enormous number of things she does everyday. fortunately, it looks as&#10;if she will be ok in the long run.&#10;george w. richards&#10;creekside builders, llc&#10;&#10;&#10;

area designated by the city of austin&#10;for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete&#10;in less than 6 months. additionally, many of the current and more severe&#10;water treatment ordinances have been waived. i have estimated the lot&#10;improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in north&#10;austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street&#10;widening. even though this property is not likely to require street&#10;widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond&#10;requirement, i used this data to be cautious.&#10; the lone star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not&#10;expected to impact sales significantly. other projects have been quite&#10;successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the&#10;adjoining single family residential and a project at st. edwards university.&#10;as with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods&#10;is uneven. we have included a fence around the entire property, but may&#10;only put it on westgate and cameron loop. gated communities are far&#10;preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer&#10;preferences.&#10;the seller accepted our offer thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and&#10;an extended escrow. this will enable us to probably obtain an approved site&#10;plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into&#10;an a&amp;d loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.&#10;this analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the&#10;profits of the project. as we discussed in san marcos, we can also discuss&#10;having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity&#10;with your profit in the lot. i believe this would facilitate the use of a&#10;1031 exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a&#10;rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then&#10;be the equity for that project. you would need to discuss this with an&#10;exchange expert first. larry lewter knows an expert in the field in san&#10;antonio if you do not know anyone.&#10;i will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,&#10;by airborne express today for saturday delivery.&#10;once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to&#10;schedule a tour of the site and the area. please get back to me as soon as&#10;your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any&#10;time. you can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either&#10;512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110. my cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is&#10;512-338-1103. i look forward to hearing from you and to working with you&#10;on this project that is sure to be a major winner.&#10;i regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual&#10;events these past few weeks. a small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg&#10;downdrafts hit the south part of austin where we are building 10 town homes.&#10;one of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to&#10;start the next day. the severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough&#10;to knock it down. the city shut down the project for a week and it took&#10;another week to get every thing back on tract. then last week i had to take&#10;my wife to emergency. she has a bulge in the material between the vertebra&#10;in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this&#10;past week.. there is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize&#10;the enormous number of things she does everyday. fortunately, it looks as&#10;if she will be ok in the long run.&#10;george w. richards&#10;creekside builders, llc&#10;&#10;&#10;

(i thought his&#10;sales price was $187,000.) at this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell&#10;for $203,108.&#10;what is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the&#10;rent-ability. you have all of our current rental and cost data for your own&#10;evaluation. as for rent-ability, i believe that we have shown that the&#10;3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market. in fact, if we&#10;were able to purchase additional lots from regan we would build 4 bedroom&#10;units along with the 3-bedroom plan.&#10;phillip, i will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.&#10;sincerely,&#10;george w. richards&#10;creekside builders, llc&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

local utilities &#10;&#10; ( september 05, 2000 ) &#10;&#10;&#10; in 1997, a little-known silicon valley company called exodus&#10; communications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in &#10;tukwila. &#10;&#10; the mission was to handle the internet traffic and &#10;computer servers for the&#10; region&apos;s growing number of dot-coms. &#10;&#10; fast-forward to summer 2000. exodus is now wrapping up &#10;construction&#10; on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than &#10;a mile from its&#10; original facility. sitting at the confluence of several &#10;fiber optic backbones, the&#10; exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and &#10;eventually&#10; house internet servers for firms such as avenue a, &#10;microsoft and onvia.com. &#10;&#10; exodus is not the only company building massive data &#10;centers near seattle.&#10; more than a dozen companies -- with names like abovenet, &#10;globix and&#10; hostpro -- are looking for facilities here that will house &#10;the networking&#10; equipment of the internet economy. &#10;&#10; it is a big business that could have an effect on &#10;everything from your&#10; monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access &#10;your favorite web sites.&#10;&#10; data centers, also known as co-location facilities and &#10;server farms, are&#10; sprouting at such a furious pace in tukwila and the kent &#10;valley that some&#10; have expressed concern over whether seattle city light and &#10;puget sound&#10; energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, &#10;high-security&#10; facilities. &#10;&#10; &quot;we are talking to about half a dozen customers that &#10;are requesting 445&#10; megawatts of power in a little area near southcenter mall,&quot; &#10;said karl&#10; karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for puget sound &#10;energy. &quot;that is&#10; the equivalent of six oil refineries.&quot; &#10;&#10; a relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, &#10;the rise of the internet&#10; data center has some utility veterans scratching their &#10;heads. &#10;&#10; puget sound energy last week asked the washington &#10;utilities and&#10; transportation commission to accept a tariff on the new &#10;data centers. the&#10; tariff is designed to protect the company&apos;s existing &#10;residential and business&#10; customers from footing the bill for the new base stations &#10;necessary to support&#10; the projects. those base stations could cost as much as $20 &#10;million each,&#10; karzmar said. &#10;&#10; not to be left behind, seattle city light plans to &#10;bring up the data center&#10; issue on thursday at the seattle city council meeting. &#10;&#10; for the utilities that provide power to homes, &#10;businesses and schools in the&#10; region, this is a new and complex issue. &#10;&#10; on one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing &#10;appetite for power --&#10; represent potentially lucrative business customers. the &#10;facilities run 24 hours a&#10; day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a &#10;constant revenue&#10; stream. on the other hand, they require so much energy that &#10;they could&#10; potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital &#10;expenditures. &#10;&#10; who will pay for those expenditures and what it will &#10;mean for power rates&#10; in the area is still open to debate. &#10;&#10; &quot;these facilities are what we call extremely dense &#10;loads,&quot; said bob royer,&#10; director of communications and public affairs at seattle &#10;city light. &#10;&#10; &quot;the entire university of washington, from stadium &#10;lights at the football&#10; game to the medical school, averages 31 megawatts per day. &#10;we have data&#10; center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 &#10;and 50 megawatts.&quot; &#10;&#10; with more than 1.5 million square feet, the intergate &#10;complex in tukwila is&#10; one of the biggest data centers. sabey corp. re-purchased &#10;the 1.35 million&#10; square-foot intergate east facility last september from &#10;boeing space &amp;&#10; defense. in less than 12 months, the developer has leased &#10;92 percent of the&#10; six-building complex to seven different co-location &#10;companies. &#10;&#10; &quot;it is probably the largest data center park in the &#10;country,&quot; boasts laurent&#10; poole, chief operating officer at sabey. exodus, icg &#10;communications,&#10; netstream communications, pac west telecomm and zama &#10;networks all&#10; lease space in the office park. &#10;&#10; after building exodus&apos; first tukwila facility in 1997, &#10;sabey has become an&#10; expert in the arena and now has facilities either under &#10;management or&#10; development in los angeles, spokane and denver. poole &#10;claims his firm is&#10; one of the top four builders of internet data centers in &#10;the country. &#10;&#10; as more people access the internet and conduct &#10;bandwidth-heavy tasks&#10; such as listening to online music, poole said the need for &#10;co-location space in&#10; seattle continues to escalate. &#10;&#10; but it is not just seattle. the need for data center &#10;space is growing at a&#10; rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, &#10;causing similar&#10; concerns among utilities in places such as texas and &#10;california. &#10;&#10; exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location &#10;space, plans to nearly&#10; double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. &#10;while companies&#10; such as amazon.com run their own server farms, many &#10;high-tech companies&#10; have decided to outsource the operations to companies such &#10;as exodus that&#10; may be better prepared for dealing with internet traffic &#10;management. &#10;&#10; &quot;we have 2 million square feet of space under &#10;construction and we plan to&#10; double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more &#10;demand right now&#10; than data center space,&quot; said steve porter, an account &#10;executive at exodus in&#10; seattle. &#10;&#10; the booming market for co-location space has left some &#10;in the local utility&#10; industry perplexed. &#10;&#10; &quot;it accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do &#10;to serve the growth,&quot;&#10; said seattle city light&apos;s royer. &quot;the utility industry is &#10;almost stunned by this, in&#10; a way.&quot; &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

los angeles, may 14 (bloomberg energy) -- most western u.s.&#10;spot power prices for delivery tomorrow slumped as supply&#10;outstripped demand.&#10; at the sp-15 delivery point in southern california, peak&#10;power dropped $186.88 to a bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt-&#10;hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range.&#10; &quot;air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing&#10;prices to decline,&quot; said one southwest trader.&#10; according to weather services corp., of lexington&#10;massachusetts, temperatures in los angeles were expected to reach&#10;75 degrees fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight.&#10; at the palo verde switchyard in arizona, peak power sank&#10;$202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a bloomberg index of $220.48 as&#10;traders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range.&#10; traders said that arizona&apos;s public service co. 1,270-megawatt&#10;palo verde-1 nuclear plant in wintersburg, arizona, increased&#10;production to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a&#10;scheduled refueling outage that began march 31.&#10; at the mid-columbia trading point in washington, peak power&#10;slumped 47.5 percent from friday&apos;s sunday-monday package to a&#10;bloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00.&#10; according to belton, missouri-based weather derivatives inc.,&#10;temperatures in the pacific northwest will average 1.2 degrees&#10;fahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling&#10;demand 84 percent below normal.&#10; &quot;we are expecting rain in the pacific northwest which is&#10;causing temperatures to drop,&quot; said one northwest trader.&#10; at the np-15 delivery point in northern california, peak&#10;power fell $189.39 to a bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at&#10;$175.00-$228.00.&#10; according the california independent system operator today&apos;s&#10;forecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743&#10;megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts.&#10;&#10;-robert scalabrino&#10;&#10;&#10;northeast power prices fall with more generation, less demand&#10;&#10; philadelphia, may 14 (bloomberg energy) -- an increase in&#10;available generation coupled with less weather-related demand,&#10;caused next-day power prices in the northeast u.s. to fall as much&#10;as 11.3 percent this morning, traders said.&#10; according to weather derivatives corp. of belton, missouri,&#10;temperatures in the northeast will average within one degree&#10;fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and&#10;cooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively.&#10; in the pennsylvania-new jersey-maryland interconnection, peak&#10;power scheduled for tuesday delivery was assessed at a bloomberg&#10;volume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 from&#10;friday.&#10; &quot;there&apos;s just no weather out there,&quot; said one pjm-based&#10;trader. &quot;there&apos;s no need for air conditioning, and no need for&#10;heating. as far as i can tell, it&apos;s going to be that way all week&#10;long.&quot;&#10; peak loads in pjm are projected to average less than 30,000&#10;megawatts through friday.&#10; traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for&#10;the dip. interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned to&#10;service today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected to&#10;hit the grid tomorrow.&#10; next-day prices fell across all three zones of the new york&#10;power pool, with increased output at the nine mile point 1 and 2&#10;nuclear power facilities.&#10; the nuclear regulator commission reported nine mile point 1&#10;at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion of&#10;a refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt nine mile point 2 at&#10;full power following unplanned maintenance. both units are owned&#10;and operated by niagara mohawk.&#10; zone j, which comprises new york city, slipped $4.50 to&#10;$58.50, while zones g and a fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to&#10;$51.25 and $40.00 indices.&#10; ~&#10;-karyn rispoli&#10;&#10;&#10;weather-related demand drives mid-continent power prices up&#10;&#10; cincinnati, may 14 (bloomberg energy) -- day-ahead peak&#10;power prices rose today in the mid-continent u.s. as high&#10;weather-related demand was expected in the midwest and southeast,&#10;traders said.&#10; &quot;it&apos;s supposed to be pretty warm in the tva (tennessee&#10;valley authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from cinergy&#10;to there,&quot; one east central area reliability council trader said.&#10;&quot;dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because of&#10;that.&quot;&#10; the bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered tuesday&#10;into the cincinnati-based cinergy corp. transmission system rose&#10;$3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25&#10;when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired.&#10; cinergy power for wednesday-friday delivery sold at $39.00&#10;and power for may 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from the&#10;southeast was expected to remain high into next week.&#10; next-day power in tva sold $2.15 higher on average at&#10;$28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in nashville, tennessee,&#10;forecast at 87 degrees fahrenheit through thursday.&#10; &quot;things should continue along these lines for the rest of&#10;the week, because there&apos;s enough power to get down there but not&#10;so much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices,&quot; an&#10;ecar trader said.&#10; in mid-america interconnected network trading, demand from&#10;the cinergy hub and the entergy corp. grid pulled prices up,&#10;though traders said transmission problems limited volume.&#10; peak monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at the&#10;chicago-based commonwealth edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50,&#10;and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, with&#10;trades from $32.00-$40.00.&#10; mid-continent area power pool peak spot power prices also&#10;climbed today, showing the largest increase in the region as&#10;above-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problems&#10;isolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs.&#10; for-tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northern&#10;mapp at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southern&#10;half of the region at $45.00-$52.00.&#10; lexington, massachusetts-based weather services corp.&#10;predicted tomorrow&apos;s high temperature would be 85 degrees in&#10;minneapolis and 91 degrees in omaha, nebraska.&#10; &quot;there&apos;s no available transmission from comed, and problems&#10;getting power out of ameren&apos;s grid too,&quot; one mapp trader said.&#10;&quot;it&apos;s likely to cause problems all week, since it&apos;s hot here and&#10;down in spp (the southwest power pool).&quot;&#10;&#10;-ken fahnestock&#10;&#10;&#10;southeast power prices mixed as southern markets heat up&#10;&#10; atlanta, may 14 (bloomberg energy) -- u.s. southeast spot&#10;electricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned to&#10;major southern u.s. population centers, traders said.&#10; forecasters from lexington, massachusetts-based weather&#10;services corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the atlanta&#10;vicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees fahrenheit, 5&#10;degrees higher than today&apos;s projected high. cooler weather is&#10;expected to begin wednesday.&#10; conversely, in the nashville, tennessee, vicinity,&#10;temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week,&#10;propelling air conditioning demand, traders said.&#10; the bloomberg southeast electric reliability council&#10;regional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour from&#10;equivalent trades made friday for delivery today, to $37.20.&#10;trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50.&#10; on the tennessee valley authority grid, power traded an&#10;average of $2.15 higher at a bloomberg index of $34.44 amid&#10;trades in the $28.00-$37.00 range.&#10; in texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for ub firm&#10;energy to a bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traders&#10;complained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000.&#10; &quot;there&apos;s just no overnight load to do anything with the&#10;supply we have,&quot; said one texas-based utility power trader.&#10;&quot;last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree&#10;(fahrenheit) days. this year so far, the highest we&apos;ve seen is&#10;85 degrees, so that&apos;s about 10 degrees below normal for us.&quot;&#10; on the entergy corp. grid, day-ahead peak power for&#10;tomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were done&#10;at a bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than friday. traders&#10;said forecasts for cooler weather through much of the south&#10;starting wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at&#10;$35-$36.&#10; traders said southern co. was purchasing day-ahead energy&#10;at $37 from utilities in the virginia-carolinas region because&#10;power from vacar was cheaper than from utilities in serc.&#10; southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a bloomberg&#10;index of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range.&#10; in the forward power markets, entergy power for the&#10;balance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though later&#10;trades were noted as high as $48.75. balance-of-may entergy&#10;power was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traders&#10;said.&#10; on the tva grid, power for the balance of this week was&#10;bid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. firm energy for&#10;the balance of may was discussed at $41, though no new trades&#10;were noted.&#10;&#10;-brian whary&#10;&#10;&#10;u.k. power prices fall as offers continue to outweigh bids&#10;&#10; london, may 14 (bloomberg energy) -- power prices in the u.k.&#10;fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy selling&#10;interest, traders said.&#10; winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds a&#10;megawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, before&#10;closing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower than&#10;friday.&#10; the contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start of&#10;the month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from one&#10;trading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it was&#10;short. volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition&#10;from another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting&#10;price levels, traders said.&#10; shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather was&#10;expected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production&#10;costs because of falling natural gas prices, traders said.&#10; june baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from friday after&#10;last trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour.&#10; on the international petroleum exchange, june natural gas&#10;futures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15&#10;pence a thermal unit. the contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since&#10;the start of last week.&#10; some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental&#10;reasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the&#10;market, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements.&#10;most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels,&#10;they said.&#10;&#10;-amal halawi&#10;&#10;&#10;nordic power soars in active trade on renewed buying interest&#10;&#10; lysaker, norway, may 14 (bloomberg energy) -- longer-term&#10;electricity prices on the nordic power exchange in lysaker,&#10;norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed&#10;to buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid&#10;limited hydro-supply, traders said.&#10; winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 norwegian kroner higher at an all&#10;time high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00&#10;megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.&#10;winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50-&#10;214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.&#10; &quot;the market crash everyone was waiting for never came; now&#10;you have to pay higher prices to develop positions,&apos;&apos; an oslo-&#10;based trader said. &quot;i&apos;m surprised that even at the peak of the&#10;snow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices are&#10;steadily climbing.&apos;&apos;&#10; precipitation across scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent&#10;above normal for the next 10 days, according to u.s. forecasters.&#10;still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a &quot;more&#10;realistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wet&#10;outlooks.&apos;&apos;&#10; tuesday&apos;s system area average price was set below expecations&#10;of 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour,&#10;down 7.45 kroner from today&apos;s price. still, traders said this was&#10;a &quot;high&apos;&apos; spot price for this time of the year.&#10; week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hour&#10;with 140 megawatts exchanged.&#10; trade volumes on nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hours&#10;generation, up 368 percent from friday&apos;s 1,169 gigawatt-hours.&#10;&#10;-alejandro barbajosa&#10;-0- (bes) may/14/2001 19:33 gmt&#10;=0f$&#10;&#10;&#10;

for davis. many legislative republicans and &#10;democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that, once the &#10;bonds are issued to replenish the general fund, davis would &quot;double dip&quot; into &#10;the fund. clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and &#10;the governor. however, it is believed once davis discloses the details of &#10;the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place. &#10;additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term &#10;power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the &#10;bond issuance happen by july 1, 2001. if not, the state may be in breach of &#10;contract. sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge &#10;loan legislation by may 8th, having a bond issuance by july 1st will be very &#10;difficult.&#10;&#10;the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state &#10;would &quot;eat&quot; the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general &#10;fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 &#10;billion. however, the reportedly now are not going to offer even this &#10;concession. sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full &#10;disclosure of the governor&apos;s plan for handling the crisis, including the &#10;details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they &#10;will support the bond issuance to go forward.&#10;&#10;currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan; ab 8x and ab &#10;31x. ab 8x authorizes the dwr to sell up to $10 billion in bonds. this bill &#10;passed the senate in march, but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of &#10;republican support. ab 31x deals with energy conservation programs for &#10;community college districts. however, sources report this bill may be &#10;amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen, &#10;currently in ab 8x. senator bowen&apos;s language states that the state should &#10;get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be &#10;likely to cause a socal bankruptcy). &#10; &#10;according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature, &#10;republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money &#10;available in the general fund. for instance, tony strickland has stated &#10;that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion) should be issued. &#10;other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds. the &#10;republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday. additionally, &#10;lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and &#10;there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan.&#10; &#10;key points of the bridge financing&#10;initial loan amount: $4.125 b&#10;lenders: jp morgan $2.5 b&#10; lehman brothers $1.0 b&#10; bear stearns $625 m&#10;tax exempt portion: of the $4.125 b; $1.6 b is expected to be tax-exempt&#10;projected interest rate: taxable rate 5.77%&#10; tax-exempt rate 4.77%&#10;current projected &#10;blended ir: 5.38%&#10;maturity date: august 29, 2001&#10;for more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510&#10;&#10;bill sb 6x passed the senate yesterday, but little can be done at this time&#10;the senate passed sb 6x yesterday, which authorizes $5 billion to create the &#10;california consumer power and conservation authority. the $5 billion &#10;authorized under sb 6x is not the same as the $5 billion that must be &#10;authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased, or the &#10;additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing &#10;power going forward. again, the republicans are not in support of these &#10;authorizations. without the details of the long-term power contracts the &#10;governor has negotiated, the republicans do not know what the final bond &#10;amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to &#10;support. no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb &#10;6x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid &#10;for purchasing power. also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for &#10;the california public power and conservation authority. however, this can &#10;be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this &#10;idea earlier in the crisis.&#10; &#10;socal edison and bankruptcy&#10;at this point, two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy. the &#10;first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the &#10;governor. the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is &#10;august 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier. according &#10;to sources, the state has yet to sign the mou with socal, though socal has &#10;signed it. the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis &#10;and the senate lack the votes needed to pass. if the legislature indicates &#10;that it will not pas the mou, socal would likely file for voluntary &#10;bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. &#10;&#10;the second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond &#10;issuance, would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31x (bridge loan) &#10;stating that the dwr would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, &#10;then the utilities would receive the residual amount. in other words, the &#10;state will get paid before the utilities. if this language is included and &#10;passed by the legislature, it appears likely that socal will likely file for &#10;bankruptcy. socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and &#10;the dwr proportionately from rate payments.&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

&#10;level entrance to enron center north until saturn ring access is available. &#10;garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an &#10;exit in the event of elevator trouble. &#10;&#10;if you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to &#10;parking and transportation as soon as you reach a decision. following your &#10;email, arrangements

power authority (x.bch), is the only energy company in the northwest&#10;region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the iso paid&#10;about $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.&#10;but that still wasn&apos;t enough juice.&#10;the los angeles department of water and power sold the iso 1,200 megawatts&#10;of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of&#10;$250/mwh. the ladwp, which is not governed by the iso, needs 3,800 megawatts&#10;of power to serve its customers. it is free sell power instate above the&#10;$250/mwh price cap.&#10;the ladwp has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. the&#10;municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power&#10;into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. however, the ladwp&#10;is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. the suit&#10;claims the ladwp sells some of its power it gets from the federal bonneville&#10;power administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the&#10;market at prices 10 times higher.&#10;powerex officials wouldn&apos;t comment on the iso power sale, saying all&#10;transactions are proprietary. but the company also sold the iso 1,000&#10;megawatts tuesday - minutes before the iso was to declare rolling blackouts&#10;- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.&#10;the iso, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state&#10;no matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,&#10;which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. the iso is having&#10;to compete with investor-owned utilities in the northwest that are willing&#10;to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.&#10;the iso warned federal regulators, generators and utilities wednesday during&#10;a conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency&#10;wednesday, but wouldn&apos;t order rolling blackouts. a stage three is declared&#10;when the iso&apos;s operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is&#10;interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.&#10;but iso spokesman patrick dorinson said it would call a stage three only as&#10;a means of attracting additional electricity resources.&#10;&quot;in order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,&quot;&#10;dorinson said.&#10;edison international unit (eix) southern california edison, sempra energy&#10;unit (sre) san diego gas &amp;

&#10;&#10;as shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and &#10;existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, &#10;and appraisal total $67,050.? the due on these contracts is $61,175, of which &#10;current unpaid invoices due total $37,325.&#10;&#10;acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this &#10;project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design &#10;and other pre-construction elements.? as it is a major project for a firm of &#10;our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or &#10;rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? &#10;&#10;two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a &#10;percentage of the minimum $1.4mm fee we were to have earned and 2) based on &#10;your prior valuation of our time.? for the first, we feel that at least 25%, &#10;or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4mm fee has been earned to date.? for the &#10;second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per &#10;year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? either of these &#10;valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the &#10;forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2mm. ?however, in &#10;the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future &#10;projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per &#10;month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? as shown in the &#10;attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings &#10;the total net buyout to $78,946.? &#10;&#10;we still believe that this project needs the professional services that we &#10;offer and have provided.? however, if you accept the terms of this buyout &#10;offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are &#10;prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? &#10;if this is your &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, &#10;claudia crocker, no later than friday of this week.? the attorneys can then &#10;draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the &#10;bishops corner, ltd. partnership to you following receipt of the buyout &#10;amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.&#10;&#10;thank you.&#10;&#10;?&#10;&#10;sincerely,&#10;&#10;[image]&#10;&#10;?&#10;&#10;?&#10;&#10;?&#10;&#10;george w. richards &#10;&#10;president&#10;&#10;p.s.?????

such=20&#10;scenarios, sce would have a positive cash balance until march 30, 2001.&#10;iv. cost containment initiatives&#10;highlights&#10;sce has adopted a $460 million cost reduction plan for the year 2001.&#10;the plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital=&#10;=20&#10;improvement component as follows (in millions):&#10;operating and maintenance costs $ 77&#10;capital improvement costs 383&#10;total $ 460&#10;the plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to=&#10;=20&#10;be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=&#10;om=20&#10;contract employees.&#10;under the plan, capital improvement costs totaling $383 million are for the=&#10;=20&#10;most part being deferred to a future date.&#10;sce dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20&#10;executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20&#10;savings of approximately $92 million.&#10;v. accounting mechanisms to track stranded cost recovery (tra and tcba=20&#10;activity)&#10;highlights:&#10;as of december 31, 2000, sce reported an overcollected balance in the=20&#10;transition cost balancing account (tcba) account of $494.5 million. this=20&#10;includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20&#10;million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.&#10;as of december 31, 2000, sce reported an undercollected balance in sce=01,s=&#10;=20&#10;transition account (tra) of $4.49 billion.&#10;normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the tcba at th=&#10;e=20&#10;end of each year. however, the current generation memorandum account credit=&#10;=20&#10;balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the tcba, pursuant to=20&#10;d.01-01-018.&#10;costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the tra and revenues from=20&#10;generation are tracked in the tcba. because these costs and revenues are=20&#10;tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20&#10;expressed in the tra, are overstated.&#10;turn proposal&#10;as part of our review, the cpuc asked that we comment on the proposal of tu=&#10;rn=20&#10;to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=&#10;s.=20&#10;our comments are summarized as follows:&#10;the proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of sce in that i=&#10;t=20&#10;would not directly generate nor use cash.&#10;the proposal=01,s impact on sce=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=&#10;ift=20&#10;costs between two regulatory assets.&#10;turn=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=&#10; the=20&#10;revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =&#10;in=20&#10;the tra is overstated.&#10;vi. flow of funds analysis&#10;highlights:&#10;in the last five years, sce had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a=&#10;=20&#10;positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.&#10;during the same time period, sce paid dividends and other distributions to=&#10;=20&#10;its parent, edison international, of approximately $4.8 billion.&#10;edison international used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its=&#10;=20&#10;shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=&#10;on=20&#10;stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=&#10;ve=20&#10;and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.&#10;[there is no section vii]&#10;=20&#10;viii. earnings of california affiliates&#10;sce=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500=&#10;=20&#10;million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20&#10;in 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.=&#10;=20&#10;this increase correlates to the increase in market prices&#10;for natural gas for the same period.&#10;a copy of the report is available on the commission website at=20&#10;www.cpuc.ca.gov.&#10;=20&#10;dan&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

they&apos;re looking forward,&quot; said william burson, &#10;a trader. &quot;it makes the market for natural gas.&quot; &#10;&#10;but the market&apos;s response perplexed chris mcgill, the american gas &#10;association&apos;s director of gas supply and transportation. he had compiled the &#10;storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the &#10;numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than &#10;reality. &#10;&#10;&quot;it&apos;s a little frustrating that they don&apos;t take the time to understand what &#10;we are reporting,&quot; mcgill said. &#10;&#10;as consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- &#10;and culprits -- is on. some within the natural gas industry are pointing &#10;fingers at wall street. &#10;&#10;stephen adik, senior vice president of the indiana utility nisource, recently &#10;stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market&apos;s speculators for &#10;the rise in gas prices. &#10;&#10;&quot;it&apos;s my firm belief ... that today&apos;s gas prices are being manipulated,&quot; adik &#10;told the trade magazine public utilities fortnightly. &#10;&#10;in california, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric &#10;utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. &#10;&#10;closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame &#10;for this winter&apos;s startling gas bills, having failed to protect their &#10;customers and constituents from such price spikes. &#10;&#10;most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take &#10;precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price &#10;insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas &#10;prices before they soared. &#10;&#10;&quot;we&apos;re passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,&quot; said paul &#10;snider, a spokesman for missouri gas energy. &#10;&#10;but critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. &#10;&#10;&quot;there&apos;s been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to &#10;change,&quot; said ed krapels, director of gas power services for energy security &#10;analysis inc., an energy consulting firm in wakefield, mass. &#10;&#10;&#10;hot topic &#10;&#10;consumers know one thing for certain: their heating bills are up sharply. in &#10;many circles, little else is discussed. &#10;&#10;the rev. vincent fraser of glad tidings assembly of god in kansas city is &#10;facing a $1,456 december bill for heating the church -- more than double the &#10;previous december&apos;s bill. church members are suffering from higher bills as &#10;well. &#10;&#10;the sunday collection is down, said fraser, who might have to forgo part of &#10;his salary. for the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial &#10;pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. &#10;&#10;&quot;it&apos;s the talk of the town here,&quot; he said. &#10;&#10;a year ago that wasn&apos;t a fear. wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per &#10;thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn&apos;t make it worthwhile &#10;to drill for gas. utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by &#10;customers. &#10;&#10;but trouble was brewing. by spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand &#10;cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage &#10;for winter. &#10;&#10;there was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. by early november, &#10;prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. the federal energy information &#10;administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating &#10;bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. &#10;&#10;but $10 gas was coming. below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, &#10;including the kansas city area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas &#10;markets. &#10;&#10;&quot;it&apos;s all about the weather,&quot; said krapels of energy security analysis. &#10;&#10;wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the new york &#10;traders. natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile &#10;commodity in the world. &#10;&#10;&#10;setting the price &#10;&#10;in the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of &#10;gas, allowing it to float. in 1990, the new york mercantile began trading &#10;contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had &#10;widespread influence over gas prices. &#10;&#10;the futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon &#10;as next month or as far ahead as three years. suppliers can lock in sale &#10;prices for the gas they expect to produce. and big gas consumers, from &#10;utilities to companies such as farmland industries inc., can lock in what &#10;they pay for the gas they expect to use. &#10;&#10;there are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention &#10;of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge &#10;of natural gas. &#10;&#10;but if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don&apos;t need to &#10;know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they&apos;re trading. like all &#10;futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. that leverage adds to &#10;their volatility and to the traders&apos; ability to make or lose a lot of money &#10;in a short time. &#10;&#10;as december began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less &#10;than $7 per thousand cubic feet. by the end of the month it was nearly $10. &#10;much of the spark for the rally came from the american gas association&apos;s &#10;weekly storage numbers. &#10;&#10;utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to &#10;need in the winter. &#10;&#10;going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than &#10;average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in &#10;hopes that the summer&apos;s unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. &#10;&#10;still, the american gas association offered assurances that supplies would be &#10;sufficient. but when below-normal temperatures arrived in november, the &#10;concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. &#10;&#10;then the american gas association reported the lowest year-end storage &#10;numbers since they were first published in 1994. still, said the &#10;association&apos;s mcgill, there was sufficient gas in storage. &#10;&#10;but some utility executives didn&apos;t share that view. william eliason, vice &#10;president of kansas gas service, said that if december&apos;s cold snap had &#10;continued into january, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. &#10;&#10;&quot;i was getting worried,&quot; he said. &#10;&#10;then suddenly the market turned when january&apos;s weather turned warmer. &#10;wednesday&apos;s storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices &#10;dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. &#10;&#10;&#10;just passing through &#10;&#10;some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but &#10;pass their fuel costs on to customers. &#10;&#10;among area utilities, kansas gas service increased its customers&apos; cost-of-gas &#10;charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. and missouri gas &#10;energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin wednesday. &#10;&#10;sheila lumpe, chairwoman of the missouri public service commission, said last &#10;month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could &#10;be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve &#10;energy. &#10;&#10;kansas gas service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to &#10;save an average customer about $25 this winter. &#10;&#10;missouri gas energy has no hedging program. it waited until fall to seek an &#10;extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not &#10;guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. &#10;&#10;now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left &#10;customers with such high gas bills. and regulators are being asked whether &#10;they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel &#10;costs. &#10;&#10;on friday, doug micheel, senior counsel of the missouri office of the public &#10;counsel, said his office would ask the missouri public service commission to &#10;perform an emergency audit of missouri gas energy&apos;s gas purchasing practices. &#10;&#10;&quot;consumers are taking all the risk,&quot; micheel said. &quot;it&apos;s time to consider &#10;some changes.&quot; &#10;&#10;&#10;to reach steve everly, call (816) 234-4455 or send e-mail to &#10;severly@kcstar.com. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;------------------------------------------------------------------------------&#10;--&#10;all content , 2001 the kansas city star </body></mail>

to develop solutions to a number of issues &#10;including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities. &#10;he was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding ldc gas &#10;purchases. as already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding &#10;some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.&#10;his ideas: the gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously &#10;under serious consideration and some of which were mere &quot;brainstorming&quot;. &#10;some of these ideas would require legislative action.&#10;state may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a &quot;couple&quot; of &#10;generation plants. the gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that &#10;they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases. this &#10;was a frequently recurring theme.&#10;utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus &#10;basis to consumers.&#10;municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in &#10;california.&#10;state universities (including uc/csu and the community colleges) would more &#10;widely deploy distributed generation.&#10;expand in-state gas production.&#10;take state lands gas royalties in kind.&#10;negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for &#10;addtional gas supplies.&#10;empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant &#10;maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at &#10;any one time.&#10;condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.&#10;either eliminate the iso or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear &#10;more about how nordpool works(jeff- someone in schroeder&apos;s group should be &#10;able to help out here).&#10;wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state. we made &#10;some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy &#10;some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation &#10;thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control &#10;approach with generators.&#10;securitize uncollected power purchase costs.&#10;to dos: (jeff, again i&apos;d like to prevail on you to assemble the group&apos;s &#10;thoughts and get them to kari)&#10;he wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- &#10;not just the 5 one year strips.&#10;he wants comments on his proposals by tuesday.&#10;he would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the &#10;deal.&#10;he wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the &#10;forward contracting issues.&#10;thanks to everyone for their help. we made some progress today.&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

&#10;&lt;clclegal2@aol.com&gt; &#10;subject: investment structure&#10;&#10;&#10;structure:&#10;typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or llc)&#10;general partner. the general partner owns 1% of the project and carries the&#10;liability of construction.&#10;&#10;land ownership &amp; loans&#10;the property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and&#10;any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in&#10;the name of the limited partnership. each of the individual investors and&#10;all of the principals in creekside would also personally guarantee the&#10;loans. if the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means&#10;that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor&apos;s share of profits&#10;is reduced.&#10;&#10;all loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are&#10;full recourse loans. if we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,&#10;the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be&#10;non-recourse.&#10;&#10;use of initial investment&#10;the initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &amp;&#10;architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for&#10;organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals. unlike&#10;many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to&#10;creekside builders, llc. these professional expenses will be incurred over&#10;the estimated 6 month design and approval period.&#10;&#10;early land costs&#10;the $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost&#10;represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of&#10;extensions on closing. as an alternative, we can close into a land loan at&#10;probably 70% of appraised value. with a land value equal to the purchase&#10;price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated&#10;monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus&#10;approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.&#10;&#10;equity at improvement loan&#10;once the site plan is approved by the city of austin, the city will require&#10;the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as&#10;the &quot;fiscals&quot;. this cost represents a bond for the completion of&#10;improvements that coa considers vital and these funds are released once the&#10;improvements have been completed and accepted by coa. this release will be&#10;for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after&#10;completion. releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should&#10;expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot&#10;improvement construction. these fiscals are usually posted in cash or an&#10;irrevocable letter of credit. as such, they have to be counted as a&#10;development cost, even though they are not spent. because they are not&#10;spent no interest is charged on these funds.&#10;&#10;the lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a&#10;finished lot, which i suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as&#10;high as $25,000. this would produce a loan amount of $15,000 on $20,000&#10;per lot. with estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, &apos;fiscals&apos; at&#10;$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000&#10;which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. the investment prior to&#10;obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement&#10;provided it was for direct costs. thus, the additional equity for the&#10;improvement loan would be $0-$184,000. even if the maximum loan would&#10;cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds&#10;spent. the higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the&#10;preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. the engineer is preparing a&#10;tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can&#10;significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.&#10;&#10;phasing works as follows. if the first phase was say 40 units, the total&#10;lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot. of this, probably&#10;$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost. the&#10;improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design&#10;costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and&#10;landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land. the land loan for&#10;undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which i would&#10;estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot. then the&#10;loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot. this would give&#10;you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required&#10;of $241,000. this was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing&#10;is depended on a more careful assessment by the civil engineer as the&#10;separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility&#10;standpoint.&#10;&#10;construction loans&#10;there are three types of construction loans. first, is a speculative&#10;(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. second, is&#10;a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the&#10;builder/developers name. third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction&#10;loan in the name of the buyer. we expect to have up to 8 spec loans to&#10;start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans&#10;in the name of the builder/developer. we do not expect to have any&#10;construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too&#10;difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.&#10;&#10;spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for&#10;pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will&#10;be from 80% to 95% of value.&#10;&#10;disbursements&#10;disbursements will be handled by the general partner to cover current and&#10;near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority&#10;payments and then to the partners per the agreement. the general partner&#10;will contract with creekside builders, llc to construct the units and the&#10;fee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to&#10;15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.&#10;these fees are the only monies to creekside, larry lewter or myself prior to&#10;calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership&#10;expenses and b) direct payment to cb for any subcontractor costs that it has&#10;to perform. for example, if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or&#10;cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this&#10;function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain&#10;from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.&#10;finally, cb will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is&#10;used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. at present cb does not own&#10;any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track&#10;to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.&#10;&#10;reporting&#10;we are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.&#10;what did you have in mind? i would like to use some form of internet based&#10;reporting.&#10;&#10;bookkeeping&#10;i am not sure what you are referring to by the question, &quot;bookkeeping&#10;procedures to record actual expenses?&quot; please expand.&#10;&#10;investor input&#10;we are glad to have the investor&apos;s input on design and materials. as always&#10;the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my&#10;experience i have always been able to reach consensus. as you, and i presume&#10;keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every&#10;effort to be accommodating.&#10;&#10;creekside proceedures&#10;cb procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as&#10;formal as your question indicates. in the extremely tight labor market&#10;obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. for the professional&#10;subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. finally,&#10;for vendors they are constantly shopped.&#10;&#10;pre-selected professionals, subs and vendors&#10;yes there are many different subs that have been identified and i can&#10;provide these if you are interested.&#10;&#10;i know i have not answered everything, but this is a starting point. call&#10;when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.&#10;&#10;sincerely,&#10;&#10;george richards&#10;president, creekside builders, llc&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;

it&apos;s possible that&#10;farmers will not have as much as they want,&quot; rosenbury said. royster-clark&#10;inc., a norfolk and new york city-based fertilizer manufacturer and&#10;distributor, has shut down its one plant in east dubuque, ill.,&#10;indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning next&#10;month. the story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justify&#10;continued production. &quot;we believe it&apos;s likely this is a speculative bubble&#10;[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we&apos;ll be able to&#10;buy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen,&quot; said paul&#10;m. murphy, the company&apos;s managing director for financial planning. a&#10;continuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and&#10;raise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers&apos; decisions to&#10;plant feed corn, he said. &quot;it&apos;s sticker shock.&quot;&#10;according to wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas&#10;remains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --&#10;farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. in the&#10;aluminum industry, several smaller producers have joined kaiser, the&#10;industry&apos;s no. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted lloyd o&apos;carroll, an&#10;analyst with bb&amp;t capital markets in richmond.&#10;aluminum production in november was 8.3 percent below that of november 1999,&#10;and december&apos;s production will be lower still, he said. &quot;we&apos;ll get more&#10;production cut announcements, i think,&quot; he said. a slowing in the u.s. and&#10;world economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum&#10;supplies. &quot;but if the world economy doesn&apos;t fall completely apart, then&#10;[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly more&#10;than the current forecast,&quot; he said. in kaiser&apos;s case, it&apos;s an open question&#10;how much of its electric windfall it will keep. kaiser is contractually&#10;entitled to buy electricity from bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour,&#10;says spokesman scott lamb. that is the power it has sold back to bonneville&#10;for $550 a megawatt hour for december.&#10;but the bonneville authority is pressuring kaiser to use these and future&#10;profits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants,&#10;to invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund to&#10;bonneville&apos;s other customers, said bonneville spokesman ed mosey. kaiser and&#10;bonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after&#10;next october, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries&#10;to kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. &quot;out&#10;here, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. there has to be an&#10;ethical dimension to this and we&apos;re not shy in trying to make sure they live&#10;up their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power,&quot; mosey&#10;said.&#10;, 2000 the washington post company&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

strong technical, financial background to craft value &#10;propositions. gerry cashiola and greg pyle deferred to his judgement in the &#10;11/16th meeting)&#10;&#10;matt,&#10; &#10;on november 10th, gss business development took hp through a tour of enron&apos;s &#10;trading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit &#10;center on the trading floor. this tour was one meeting, amongst several, &#10;held in october and november to provide hp a full overview of enron&apos;s &#10;products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at enron &#10;(ebs, gss buy side -- peter goebel).&#10;&#10;on november 16th gss business development, patrick tucker, and dale clark &#10;outlined 3 possible ebs/hp focus areas -- connectivity, storage, and &#10;wireless. three ebs action items were defined in that meeting:&#10;&#10;1) hp was to provide an hp contact on connectivity (to date, gerry cashiola &#10;has stalled on providing this). sarah-joy will continue to pursue this &#10;information and get a sense from gerry cashiola of what he means by short &#10;term opportunity. what is hp&apos;s time horizon for short term?&#10;&#10;2) ebs and gss/bd was to facilitate a conference call on storage with ravi to &#10;explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8)&#10;&#10;3) gss/bd was to facilitate a conference call with peter goebel, gss it &#10;sourcing portfolio leader (set for 12/14) &#10;&#10;in conversations with you, jennifer medcalf and myself this morning, several &#10;decisions on forward-looking strategy with hp/ebs were confirmed:&#10;&#10;&#10;gerry cashiola has been unable to take control of the process. more &#10;importantly, despite numerous visits to enron in which he has had overviews &#10;of enron&apos;s products and services; met with peter goebel and his team on the &#10;gss buy side, and participated in an experience enron tour, gerry has been &#10;unable to define an hp business proposition. the coordination between &#10;cashiola (short term initiative) morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has &#10;remained unorganized. these initiatives need to be developed separately.&#10;&#10;&#10;clearly, the conversations with hp need to be elevated to a more senior &#10;level so ebs can work with hp decision makers who can move the relationship &#10;forward at a strategic level. as the relationship is developed at this &#10;strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way. but &#10;gerry&apos;s short term plans will not be the focus of the ebs/hp relationship, &#10;rather a by-product. to facilitate this process of elevating the &#10;relationship, jennifer medcalf and i are following up with bill lovejoy and &#10;greg pyle. lovejoy&apos;s boss is dan sytsma, vp of hp&apos;s america&apos;s central &#10;region.&#10;&#10; in the conference call thursday, 12/14 with peter goebel and hp regarding &#10;wireless initiatives, peter will support the gss/bd push for the hp/ebs &#10;initiative by reiterating the following two points: &#10;&#10; a) enron is already an hp customer; the onus is on hp to move forward on &#10;the process of building a strategic relationship (ibm and lexmark are only &#10;some of the hp competitors who could push them out of the running)&#10;&#10; b) hp&apos;s ability to bring the right people to the table will influence hp&apos;s &#10;business relationship process with enron&#10;&#10; patrick tucker and dale clark could build their relationship with bill &#10;dwyer, chief architect e-services solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in &#10;the near term. perhaps, plan a visit to cupertino, california to see dwyer &#10;in person. &#10;&#10;&#10;we look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and &#10;other opportunities. &#10;&#10;sarah-joy hunter&#10;enron corporation&#10;global strategic sourcing - business development&#10;#(713)-345-6541&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

&lt;&lt;re: enron energy management contract - update.&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;re: enron building&#10;services novi mi.&gt;&gt;&#10;&#10;regarding the ebs deal, from a business perspective we need to do a level&#10;set very quickly. compaq wants to get this settled and move on in a positive&#10;light. compaq will honor it&apos;s commitments but we need to make sure that&#10;enron does the same. the bottom line is there needs to be a resetting of&#10;expectations relative to compaq&apos;s revenue from ebs versus what actually got&#10;booked. our expectations were $96m a year based on the forecast provided by&#10;ebs, certainly not $14m (based on what we agreed to yesterday). i find it&#10;very difficult in the spirit of partnership to hear that we are being held&#10;accountable for our portion of the deal, when we don&apos;t have the revenue to&#10;off set it. based on what i have heard, both parties had shortcomings based&#10;on expectations that were set. i will speak to keith and rob this morning to&#10;see how it was left. i also need to get your perspective on the&#10;transaction. jennifer, if there is a business opportunity, compaq certainly&#10;wants to continue in pursuing that with enron. provided it&apos;s equitable for&#10;both sides. i realized that this is a difficult situation, but we will get&#10;through it.&#10;&#10;&#10;jennifer, once again i appreciate your efforts in setting the meeting up and&#10;hosting compaq. i will contact you later today.&#10;thanks,&#10;&#10;&#10;bob jordan&#10;rio grande area director&#10;compaq computer corporation&#10;&#10;tele #281-927-6350&#10;fax #281-514-7220&#10;bob.jordan@compaq.com&#10;&#10;&#10;message-id: &lt;c34eb66a4168d211984900805fbef6a6069bda22@exchou-nafd04&gt;&#10;from: &quot;earle, jerry&quot;

it is very important that i (and the enron account&#10;team) stay informed on all of these issues, so thanks again for keeping us&#10;in the loop.&#10;&#10; regards,&#10; jerry&#10;&#10;&#10; -----original message-----&#10;

subject: hp -- confidential internal document&#10;&#10;matt:&#10;&#10;as gss business development transitions the hp relationship for broadband to &#10;your team, there are several issues i wanted to clarify in terms of how the &#10;relationship has been developed and who the contacts have been to date. &#10;additionally, i outlined the discussion points/action items from this &#10;morning&apos;s meeting you held with jennifer medcalf and myself. per your &#10;request, the hp presentation complete with a listing of hp&apos;s business &#10;partners was e-mailed to you this morning.&#10;&#10;hp contacts to date: &#10;&#10;bill lovejoy, western gulf area sales manager&#10;houston, tx&#10;#(713)-439-5587&#10;(gerry cashiola&apos;s boss)&#10;&#10;gerry cashiola, sales representative &#10;houston, tx&#10;#(713)-439-5555&#10;(to date, hp person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play)&#10;&#10;greg pyle, solution control manager&#10;southeast region&#10;austin, tx &#10;(#(512)-257-5735&#10;(pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer &#10;leadership of the process to gerry cashiola)&#10;&#10;daniel morgridge, manager of internet - e-services long term alliances&#10;austin, tx&#10;#(512)-257-5736&#10;(interested in e-services/wireless longer term alliances)&#10;&#10;bill dwyer, chief architect, e-services solutions&#10;cupertino, ca&#10;#(408)-447-5240&#10;(to date, clearly the most knowledgeable person on hp&apos;s business &#10;propositions; strong technical, financial background to craft value &#10;propositions. gerry cashiola and greg pyle deferred to his judgement in the &#10;11/16th meeting)&#10;&#10;matt,&#10; &#10;on november 10th, gss business development took hp through a tour of enron&apos;s &#10;trading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit &#10;center on the trading floor. this tour was one meeting, amongst several, &#10;held in october and november to provide hp a full overview of enron&apos;s &#10;products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at enron &#10;(ebs, gss buy side -- peter goebel).&#10;&#10;on november 16th gss business development, patrick tucker, and dale clark &#10;outlined 3 possible ebs/hp focus areas -- connectivity, storage, and &#10;wireless. three ebs action items were defined in that meeting:&#10;&#10;1) hp was to provide an hp contact on connectivity (to date, gerry cashiola &#10;has stalled on providing this). sarah-joy will continue to pursue this &#10;information and get a sense from gerry cashiola of what he means by short &#10;term opportunity. what is hp&apos;s time horizon for short term?&#10;&#10;2) ebs and gss/bd was to facilitate a conference call on storage with ravi to &#10;explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8)&#10;&#10;3) gss/bd was to facilitate a conference call with peter goebel, gss it &#10;sourcing portfolio leader (set for 12/14) &#10;&#10;in conversations with you, jennifer medcalf and myself this morning, several &#10;decisions on forward-looking strategy with hp/ebs were confirmed:&#10;&#10;&#10;gerry cashiola has been unable to take control of the process. more &#10;importantly, despite numerous visits to enron in which he has had overviews &#10;of enron&apos;s products and services; met with peter goebel and his team on the &#10;gss buy side, and participated in an experience enron tour, gerry has been &#10;unable to define an hp business proposition. the coordination between &#10;cashiola (short term initiative) morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has &#10;remained unorganized. these initiatives need to be developed separately.&#10;&#10;&#10;clearly, the conversations with hp need to be elevated to a more senior &#10;level so ebs can work with hp decision makers who can move the relationship &#10;forward at a strategic level. as the relationship is developed at this &#10;strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way. but &#10;gerry&apos;s short term plans will not be the focus of the ebs/hp relationship, &#10;rather a by-product. to facilitate this process of elevating the &#10;relationship, jennifer medcalf and i are following up with bill lovejoy and &#10;greg pyle. lovejoy&apos;s boss is dan sytsma, vp of hp&apos;s america&apos;s central &#10;region.&#10;&#10; in the conference call thursday, 12/14 with peter goebel and hp regarding &#10;wireless initiatives, peter will support the gss/bd push for the hp/ebs &#10;initiative by reiterating the following two points: &#10;&#10; a) enron is already an hp customer; the onus is on hp to move forward on &#10;the process of building a strategic relationship (ibm and lexmark are only &#10;some of the hp competitors who could push them out of the running)&#10;&#10;

counter offer to fedex. &#10;john&apos;s e-mail below notes that on friday 12/15 by noon he heard nothing back &#10;from pattillo. second, john is to hear back from carmen perez today, fedex &#10;account rep, on any news from fedex lawyers and team regarding fedex&apos;s &#10;response to lawsuit issue update. third, george wasaff has made himself &#10;available to fly to memphis with john this week if necessary and if this will &#10;help resolve the lawsuit issue in our favor. fourth, john has been told to &#10;begin to pull back business from fedex in terms of the gss contractual &#10;relationship. i&apos;ve asked john to keep us in the loop on the developments &#10;with these four items and what he finally decides to do 12/22 on the fedex &#10;account.&#10;&#10;hp: wireless conference call with peter g. went fine. peter g. has asked &#10;darrin to set up a follow up meeting with hp after 1/8/01 when the enron &#10;wireless team returns from london. this is in progress. efs/datawarehouse &#10;equipment meeting set for early jan. spoke with peter g.&#10;&#10;i spoke with bill dwyer directly last week and he would welcome the &#10;opportunity to work more closely with enron but would want to work in concert &#10;with the sales force. my e-mailed question to you was as follows: do we &#10;just wait to hear back from greg pyle given your phone call to him and peter &#10;g. message delivered to him on 12/14?&#10;&#10;&#10;kinko&apos;s: connected mike rabon to kinko&apos;s cio via conference call. that &#10;enables the ebs proposition to move forward with kinko&apos;s. also, connected ed &#10;quinn and chris charbonneau to vp of purchasing. he is the initial decision &#10;maker. chris charbonneau and i got on a follow up conference call with vp of &#10;purchasing and found that he had already received a business proposition from &#10;eim pulp &amp; paper team 9 months ago. but, the offer was not as competitive as &#10;the options offered by the kinko&apos;s paper mills. ed and chris have some &#10;homework to do to improve the offer and get back to the vp of purchasing. &#10;once we get past this initial hurdle, i will work with quinn and charbonneau &#10;on getting to the cfo&apos;s office as necessary. so, both sides are moving &#10;foward here.&#10;&#10;also, had ed quinn meet with craig brown and tracy f. on office automation &#10;(pulled jeff youngflesh up to speed as well) since he couldn&apos;t attend the &#10;meeting. ed had some great ideas for the process.&#10;&#10;&#10;continental: wasaff will speak briefly with ron howard on wednesday at 1:30 &#10;pm as a follow up thank-you. meeting minutes sent out. will be working with &#10;craig breslau and t. ramsey in early jan. meeting to get info. needed for &#10;airline ticket for fuel mgt. swap deal going. also, followup up with tawney, &#10;taylor, and engberg (plastics) in early jan. plastics will also be coming to &#10;gss/bd to give educational overview.&#10;&#10;csc, sonoco, instromet followup in jan. 2001.&#10;&#10;have a great holiday! i will be checking my work voicemail daily weekdays &#10;(except christmas day).&#10;&#10;sarah-joy&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;

(i did not concede) &#10;&#10; e) 2000 income. per the signed ebs server purchase agreement - compaq had &#10;to pay for the compaq purchase amount before or by dec 31, 2000 but could &#10;defer identifying the services to be used against the amount until dec 31, &#10;2002. if compaq had not used the services by dec 31, 2002 then they lost the &#10;right to spend against the amount. to gain 2000 income recognition, ebs &#10;worked with keith m and rob senders to invoice for $832,000 to cover ebs &#10;consulting services provided to compaq. again, under keith m&apos;s stewardship &#10;- they verbally agreed to pay. &#10;&#10;now with the above information - my offered next steps :&#10; a) until everything is done - maintain the &quot;stick&quot; of the ebs invoice ($4.1 &#10;million). this is being done.&#10; b) termination fee - the contract does not state a termination fee. it &#10;does state a value of $2.5 million max for liquidated damages. prior &#10;conversations have discussed compaq paying a $2.5 million termination fee &#10;(again with keith m). this could be recognized as yr 2000 income. &#10; c) consulting fee - the recognition of the $832,000 would be a 20% return on &#10;services of $4.1 million. this is a good return for a commodity &#10;transaction. so.... do we accept a lower amount to maintain a healthier &#10;relationship. &#10;&#10; so...... please let me know your thougths. we have countered with the $2.5 &#10;million with the understanding that the lower end would be $832,000. &#10;&#10;please let me know your thoughts&#10;&#10;kim godfrey&#10;director, enterprise services&#10;enron broadband services&#10;phone : 713 345 8813&#10;cell : 713 501 8105&#10;fax: 713 853 7354&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

the average time between transaction attempts, regardless &#10;of whether they are buys or sells. measured as a moving average over the last &#10;[intensity factor] transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction &#10;tibco messages for the product.&#10;obviously, the lower the intensity calculation, the higher the transaction &#10;flow. therefore a high intensity number indicates low transaction flow.&#10;intensity factor - the number of transactions to be included in the moving &#10;average intensity calculation. a possible value for this might be [4].&#10;#buys - the number of buys which have occurred.&#10;#sells - the number of sells which have occured.&#10;transaction count - could be either #buys or #sells (whichever last occured).}&#10;buy offset - the offset value which will be applied if a buy occurs.&#10;sell offset - the offset value which will be applied if a sell occurs.&#10;offset reversion ratio (orr)- the amount by which the buy offset should be &#10;reduced if a sell occurs (or amount sell offset should be reduced if a buy &#10;occurs). a possible value for this might be [0.3]. if the application of the &#10;orr results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be 1.&#10;transaction reversion ratio (trr)- the amount by which #buys should be &#10;reduced if a sell occurs (or amount #sells should be reduced if a buy &#10;occurs). a possible value for this might be [0.3]. if the application of the &#10;trr results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be equal &#10;to 1.&#10;spread minimum - the minimum spread value allowed. a possible value for this &#10;might be [0.04]&#10;spread maximum - the maximum spread value allowed. a possible value for this &#10;might be [0.50]&#10;offset minimum - the minimum offset allowed for both buys and sells. a &#10;possible value for this might be [0].&#10;offset maximum -the maximum offset allowed for both buys and sells. a &#10;possible value for this might be [0.50]&#10;initial offset - the buy and sell offset used when the program is started&#10;initial spread - the spread used when the program is started&#10;spread-offset minimum - the minimum amount by which spread must exceed &#10;offset. prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer. a &#10;possible value for this might be [0.01]&#10;dead interval - the period of time which must pass before the program will &#10;recalculate the above criteria, if no transactions have taken place during &#10;the dead interval. a possible value for this might be [240] seconds.&#10;&#10;program outputs&#10;&#10;the program should output the following variables as a result of combining &#10;the above criteria in a user-defined formula:&#10;&#10;spread (integer) - as per current stack manager&#10;offset (integer) - as per current stack manager&#10;suspension (boolean) - whether or not the product should be suspended. &#10;normally &quot;false&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;program interface and operation principles&#10;&#10;the user should be provided with a gui which will allow them to define a &#10;relationship among the above criteria, which will produce and apply the &#10;outputs to a particular product. this relationship would be defined with &#10;intensity formulas and transaction formulas. &#10;&#10;every time a transaction occurs, or a dead interval passes, the criteria will &#10;be recalculated and the user-defined formulas will be reviewed by the &#10;program. if a dead interval passes without any transactions taking place, &#10;then intensity = intensity +240 and #buys=#buys-trr and #sells=#sells-trr and &#10;buy offset = buy offset- orr and sell offset = sell offset - orr. &#10;&#10;if the user-defined formulas (see following) indicate that a change in spread &#10;should occur, then if the offset is zero (in the case of a trade occurring) &#10;or if no trade has occured (during the passing of a dead interval), the &#10;system shall perform a last trade is mid calculation around the last &#10;transaction, adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new spread &#10;value.&#10;&#10;any adjustment to the spread shall respect the spread-offset minimum. if a &#10;reduction in the spread should violate the spread-offset minimum, then the &#10;buy offset (or sell offset, or both as appropriate) shall be reduced &#10;accordingly. similarly, if the offset is increased by a transaction formula &#10;to a level greater than the spread, the spread shall be increased to maintain &#10;the spread-offset minimum.&#10;&#10;gui/formulas example:&#10;&#10;constants&#10;intensity factor: [4]&#10;dead interval: [240]&#10;offset reversion ratio (orr): [0.3]&#10;transaction reversion ratio (trr): [0.3]&#10;spread minimum [0.04]&#10;spread maximum [0.50]&#10;offset minimum [0]&#10;offset maximum [0.49]&#10;spread-offset minimum [0.01]&#10;&#10; inputs outputs&#10;intensity formula&#10;formula # intensity spread offset suspension&#10;s1 &gt;220 -0.01 n/a f&#10;s2 &lt;30 +0.01 n/a f&#10;s3 &lt;10 +0.02 n/a f&#10;&#10;transaction formula&#10;formula # # transactions spread offset suspension&#10;v1 &lt;4 n/a -0.01 f&#10;v2 &gt;3 n/a +0.01 f&#10;v3 &gt;5 +0.01 +0.02 f&#10;v4 &gt;10 +0.02 +0.04 f&#10;v5 &gt;15 +0.04 +0.15 f&#10;v6 &gt;20 n/a n/a t&#10; &#10;note that #transactions would be #buys or #sells, as appropriate. note also &#10;that #buys and #sells are not intended to be an absolute count, but rather &#10;are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently &#10;occured.&#10;&#10;in this example, all constants and formulae are editable by the user through &#10;the gui.&#10;&#10;&#10;simulation&#10;&#10;obviously, if we want to proceed, we will want to conduct several simulations &#10;to prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness. however, to give some idea of &#10;how the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular &#10;direction, please see the attached:&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;additional features&#10;&#10;system notifications&#10;&#10;there should be two kinds of notifications for the robotrader, which will be &#10;similar to stack manager garbage checks: warning and failure levels for both &#10;offset and price. the warning levels will trigger a pager message. the &#10;failure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be &#10;automatically suspended. the price checks will be against prices input by the &#10;trader (not relative price movements, but actual price). there should be both &#10;maximum and minimum price checks (e.g. gas is trading at $5.50. the &#10;notification levels could be $8 at the top end and $2 at the bottom end). &#10;offset checks will only be against a maximum value.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;dave&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

in the past that the&#10;&gt;organization said violated its ethical code.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; rabbi zimmerman, president of hebrew union college-jewish&#10;&gt;institute of learning, where he had been considered a charismatic&#10;&gt;and innovative leader, quit that post on monday, after the central&#10;&gt;conference of american rabbis suspended his rabbinical functions&#10;&gt;for at least two years, college and conference officials said.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; in a statement, the college said the suspension followed an&#10;&gt;investigation by the conference into &quot;personal relationships&quot; of&#10;&gt;rabbi zimmerman, which it did not specify other than to say that&#10;&gt;they predated his appointment as president in january 1996. rabbi&#10;&gt;zimmerman was the seventh president of the college, which was&#10;&gt;founded in 1875.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; rabbi paul j. menitoff, the conference&apos;s executive vice president,&#10;&gt;said its board approved the penalty on monday, based on a&#10;&gt;recommendation by its ethics committee, which looks into complaints&#10;&gt;about the conference&apos;s 1,700 members.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; rabbi menitoff said that conference rules prevented him from&#10;&gt;discussing the case but that the board decided rabbi zimmerman had&#10;&gt;violated a part of the ethics code, paragraph 2a, which deals with&#10;&gt;sexual conduct.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; it is included in the section of the code on &quot;personal&#10;&gt;responsibility,&quot; which covers such matters as family life, personal&#10;&gt;honesty and finances. it calls on rabbis &quot;to be scrupulous in&#10;&gt;avoiding even the appearance of sexual misconduct, whether by&#10;&gt;taking advantage of our position with those weaker than ourselves&#10;&gt;or dependent on us or succumbing to the temptations of willing&#10;&gt;adults.&quot;&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; hebrew union, which trains men and women as rabbis and cantors and&#10;&gt;in other graduate and professional fields, has 1,500 students on&#10;&gt;campuses in cincinnati, los angeles, new york and jerusalem. before&#10;&gt;becoming president, rabbi zimmerman, 58, was senior rabbi of temple&#10;&gt;emanu-el in dallas from 1985 to 1995, and senior rabbi at central&#10;&gt;synagogue in new york, from 1972 to 1985. he is married and has&#10;&gt;four children. from 1993 to 1995, he was also the conference&apos;s&#10;&gt;president.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; rabbi zimmerman&apos;s resignation was first reported yesterday in the&#10;&gt;cincinnati enquirer and the dallas morning news.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; efforts to reach him through the college and its officials were&#10;&gt;unsuccessful. the college said it appointed its provost, norman&#10;&gt;cohen, as acting president and would search for a permanent&#10;&gt;replacement.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; rabbi menitoff said the conference followed &quot;the same process that&#10;&gt;we&apos;d follow with any rabbi in the conference in similar&#10;&gt;circumstances.&quot; he said complaints against a rabbi are referred to&#10;&gt;and investigated by the ethics committee. depending on that&#10;&gt;committee&apos;s findings, the conference may dismiss the complaint,&#10;&gt;privately reprimand or publicly censure a rabbi or suspendn or&#10;&gt;expel a rabbi.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; rabbi menitoff said the decision to suspend rabbi zimmerman was&#10;&gt;&quot;very difficult and painful for everyone involved.&quot;&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; rabbi eric h. yoffie, president of the union of american hebrew&#10;&gt;congregations, the reform movement&apos;s synagogue organization, said&#10;&gt;rabbi zimmerman did not contest the findings or the judgment&#10;&gt;against him but responded to the decision &quot;with great dignity.&quot;&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; rabbi yoffie said that during his tenure as president, rabbi&#10;&gt;zimmerman added younger scholars to the faculty and expanded the&#10;&gt;college&apos;s los angeles branch so much that it will begin ordaining&#10;&gt;rabbis in 2002.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; another member of the conference, rabbi a. james rudin, emeritus&#10;&gt;director of interreligious affairs at the american jewish&#10;&gt;committee, said rabbi zimmerman&apos;s resignation was &quot;a real loss&quot; and&#10;&gt;&quot;a shock to the movement.&quot;&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; hebrew union&apos;s chairman, burton lehman, praised rabbi zimmerman as&#10;&gt;&quot;a great, great leader.&quot; mr. lehman said that rabbi zimmerman&apos;s&#10;&gt;resignation would &quot;have an impact&quot; but that the college was strong.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; &quot;transitionally, we&apos;ll be fine,&quot; mr. lehman said. &quot;we have a&#10;&gt;strong faculty that will carry this institution through this&#10;&gt;tribulation.&quot;&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt;the new york times on the web&#10;&gt;http://www.nytimes.com&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt;/-----------------------------------------------------------------\&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt;visit nytimes.com for complete access to the&#10;&gt;most authoritative news coverage on the web,&#10;&gt;updated throughout the day.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt;become a member today! it&apos;s free!&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt;http://www.nytimes.com?eta&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt;\-----------------------------------------------------------------/&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt;how to advertise&#10;&gt;---------------------------------&#10;&gt;for information on advertising in e-mail newsletters&#10;&gt;or other creative advertising opportunities with the&#10;&gt;new york times on the web, please contact alyson&#10;&gt;racer at alyson@nytimes.com or visit our online media&#10;&gt;kit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt;for general information about nytimes.com, write to&#10;&gt;help@nytimes.com.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt;copyright 2000 the new york times company</body></mail>

ebs on &#10;11/17, and i have had no calls or e-mails responding to my requests for &#10;information relative to &quot;what are your top 3 problems in this bmc situation, &#10;net works?&quot; from net works.&#10;5) so, i feel confident that there are more issues (left off the table by &#10;net works) than will be discussed, because&#10;6) net works doesn&apos;t want any of bmc&apos;s solutions. period.&#10;&#10;7) the result: ebs is on their own on their deal with bmc, as far as net &#10;works&apos; folks are concerned.&#10;&#10;in the &quot;i don&apos;t want any surprises&quot; mode, i thought i&apos;d give george a &#10;heads-up re: possible fallout around the bmc thing. i told george in this &#10;morning&apos;s staff meeting what jim crowder said to the ebs origination team (&quot;i &#10;don&apos;t see a problem here...&quot;), and what you and i suggested ebs do - buy and &#10;implement $1m of bmc&apos;s stuff, pay $2m for &quot;credit&quot;, which any ene business &#10;unit could access, etc. i also informed him that the ebs and bmc folks were &#10;likely to encourage crowder to &quot;lean on&quot; philippe (which i had recommended &#10;against). george said he would take it up w/jennie rub. &#10;&#10;if you have any questions, please let me know.&#10;jeff&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;----- forwarded by jeff youngflesh/na/enron on 12/04/2000 10:32 am -----&#10;&#10;

hi bruce,&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; i have attached a document detailing the status of microsoft&#10;&gt; certification. we have also summarized our windows 2000 development and&#10;&gt; certification methodology which is actually a two-phase approach. the&#10;&gt; most critical phase, which ensures win2k compatibility and support and&#10;&gt; includes customer testing, has been completed. the win2k agents are ga&#10;&gt; for both control-m (scheduling) and control-sa (security).&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; the next phase, which is also a key element of our development strategy,&#10;&gt; is to insure the products meet the certification requirements for&#10;&gt; microsoft win2k. this phase follows the win2k initial release as ms&#10;&gt; certification focuses on meeting certain microsoft standards and not the&#10;&gt; application&apos;s functionality - ability to work correctly in the control-m&#10;&gt; environment.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; microsoft certification does not necessarily guarantee the performance of&#10;&gt; the application. it is my understanding that one of the reasons control-m&#10;&gt; is being considered as a replacement for sys*admiral is due to the&#10;&gt; problems you are experiencing with their ms certified release.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; earlier this year we met with philippe bibi and reviewed bmc&apos;s win2k&#10;&gt; development plans. would it be helpful to set up a similar meeting with&#10;&gt; an executive from our product marketing group to discuss these in more&#10;&gt; detail?&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; one final note. i just received the following update from rusty cheves,&#10;&gt; reconfirming that control-m continues to run smoothly since we made the&#10;&gt; database changes.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; thanks rob for all the hard work last week. it seems as we have&#10;&gt; finally got this thing running smoothly. after extending the database and&#10;&gt; troubleshooting which log files were filling up we now can eval till out&#10;&gt; hearts content.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; please tell ronnie thanks for all his help as well&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; thanks again&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; rusty&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; as a next step, could we meet soon after the thanksgiving holidays? i&#10;&gt;

attained. it now appears that most of the problems were caused by the&#10;&gt; setup&#10;&gt; of the oracle database.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; once we left thursday evening and through the following day, schedule-m&#10;&gt; worked flawlessly. the new day process was last measured taking less&#10;&gt; than&#10;&gt; five minutes for 960 jobs and we approximated job volumes 14,500 per&#10;&gt; day.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; this demonstrates the reliability and scalability of control-m when&#10;&gt; installed properly. i will give you a call to discuss the results and&#10;&gt; our&#10;&gt; next steps.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; thanks,&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; rob&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; rob hallberg&#10;&gt; bmc software&#10;&gt;

&gt; to: rob hallberg (e-mail)&#10;&gt; &gt; subject: fw: recap&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; rob, will you please forward this to larry.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; larry, below is the recap we talked about.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; recap:&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; there were 2 outstanding issues.&#10;&gt; &gt; 1) new day process running 2-5 hrs.&#10;&gt; &gt; 2) jobs not running, they were all in blue or white status.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; issue number 1 was resolved the day before i arrived by tech support&#10;&gt; &gt; working with rusty. solution was to increase the oracle db from 50mg&#10;&gt; to&#10;&gt; &gt; 300mg. also the log &amp; stat files were extremely small. these files&#10;&gt; were&#10;&gt; &gt; cleaned out by rusty, however were never increased or set to truncate&#10;&gt; in&#10;&gt; &gt; oracle. they will fill up again. these files need to be set to&#10;&gt; truncate&#10;&gt; &gt; by the oracle dba or run a set of daily utilities to clean those&#10;&gt; files.&#10;&gt; &gt; we will send a draft of those utilities to be incorporated into the&#10;&gt; daily&#10;&gt; &gt; schedule.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; issue number 2 - according to a diagnostic report the agent machine&#10;&gt; lost&#10;&gt; &gt; connection with the nis server for a greater period of time than what&#10;&gt; the&#10;&gt; &gt; default settings were set. the agent is set to retry every 120&#10;&gt; seconds up&#10;&gt; &gt; to 12 times. after this period, manual activation is required. i&#10;&gt; signed&#10;&gt; &gt; on as ctmagent user and ran ag_menu. ran option 2 which showed the&#10;&gt; nis as&#10;&gt; &gt; down. i then signed on as the control-m user and ran ctm_menu.&#10;&gt; selected&#10;&gt; &gt; 7 - agent status, selected 2 - list all agent platforms unavailable.&#10;&gt; &gt; agent on bmc was in unavailable status. next selected option 3 -&#10;&gt; change&#10;&gt; &gt; agent platform to available status. after doing that, all the jobs&#10;&gt; turned&#10;&gt; &gt; to gray status and started running.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; cleaned up 2 erroneous agent names defined to control-m/server.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; i also ran a trouble shooting report which produced a file&#10;&gt; &gt; (/var/home/ctlm00/report.1116001128) from this file we could tell&#10;&gt; when&#10;&gt; &gt; the log filed filled up and when the agent stopped.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; i set up 500 jobs to run daily on bmc with multiple dependencies.&#10;&gt; all&#10;&gt; ran&#10;&gt; &gt; ok.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; i set up aprox. another 150 cyclic jobs with dependencies to run on&#10;&gt; &gt; ocsdev-1. they failed due to not using the correct owner. rusty&#10;&gt; knows&#10;&gt; &gt; what the correct owner should be. i believed i used ctlm00.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; new day process ran for approx. 12 mins.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; right before leaving rusty ran a clean_db script, which resulted in&#10;&gt; &gt; cleaning out the entire database. fortunately by design, we were&#10;&gt; able&#10;&gt; to&#10;&gt; &gt; demonstrate the recoverability by uploading the tables from ecs to&#10;&gt; the&#10;&gt; &gt; control-m server. in less than 5 minutes all was ok.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; when i left there were approx. 900 jobs running. of those approx.&#10;&gt; 400&#10;&gt; &gt; jobs were running cyclic, every 2 minutes. which meant on a daily&#10;&gt; basis&#10;&gt; &gt; approx. 14,500 jobs ran per day.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; larry, i know you asked for some type of hardware recommendations.&#10;&gt; these&#10;&gt; &gt; is something that&apos;s very subjective. as with almost any software the&#10;&gt; more&#10;&gt; &gt; memory and faster cpu the better. to do this correctly, we should&#10;&gt; have&#10;&gt; &gt; our professional services come in and do some type of assessment of&#10;&gt; your&#10;&gt; &gt; environment and the direction your heading. how many jobs per day,&#10;&gt; today,&#10;&gt; &gt; near future, etc.... how many users of ecs? how many servers?&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; in your test environment you should be able to run 2000 jobs without&#10;&gt; a&#10;&gt; &gt; major problem. your ecs nt box is on the small size, at least in the&#10;&gt; &gt; memory area. so your responses might not be as fast as desired.&#10;&gt; please&#10;&gt; &gt; remember the out of the box default settings are not tuned to run a&#10;&gt; large&#10;&gt; &gt; number of jobs. therefore database tuning is always recommended.&#10;&gt; these&#10;&gt; &gt; tuning recommendations are provided by professional services.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; by tomorrow i will send you the daily utilities.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; thanks,&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; ronnie sapp&#10;&gt; &gt; bmcsoftware&#10;&gt; &gt; incontrol business unit&#10;&gt; &gt;
